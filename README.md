# Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision
Problem set solutions for University of Michigan Deep Learning for Computer Vision course

Course link: https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/

I chose this course instead of Stanford cs231n for two reasons.

  1) The problem sets are in colab
  2) The video lectures are more recent
